<zedboy> dackel: in general the *only* way to use a computer program
         is to execute it. have you *ever* known a system utility whose
         documentation recommended either deleting it, or throwing it
         at a farm animal?
<dackel> zedboy: Ummm... yes
<zedboy> dackel: install the manpages package. it should be there
         already tho.
<zedboy> dackel: example of such a bovine utility?
* greycat wants a video of dackel throwing /usr/bin/file at a cow
